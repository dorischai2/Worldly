# Worldly
A simple website to get information about different countries using [REST Country API](https://restcountries.com/)

## Example 1: Australia

## Next steps:
Currently I have an idea to display a google map that will display the location of the country on the right side of the page.
I'm also planning to deploy the website through Vercel in the near future.
